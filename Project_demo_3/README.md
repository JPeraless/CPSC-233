## Running program from command line
The .jar file must be used to execute the program from the command line. The program takes 2 arguments as input, it will not run if any other number of arguments is given. 

The first argument is interpreted as a boolean value, meaning that "true" will be interpreted as true and any other input will be interpreted as false. The second argument is the file name from which input will be read.

If the first argument is "true", the program will attempt to open and read input from the file given as a second input. If something goes wrong when opening the file or reading the input, the program will end and let the user know that an error occurred. If successful, the program will start with the information read from the input file.

If the first argument is anything other than "true", the program will not attempt to open or read any input from the second argument. The program will start with no information.
